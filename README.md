## Proxy for Aqara Presence Sensor FP2.
CopyrightÂ© 2023 Erik Baauw. All rights reserved.

This repository provides a little daemon programme, `fp2-proxy`, that creates a virtual device mirroring an [Aqara Presence Sensor FP2](https://www.aqara.com/eu/product/presence-sensor-fp2) on a [deCONZ gateway](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin) or [Hue](https://www.philips-hue.com/) bridge.

This proxy device enables the FP2 to be used in rules on the deCONZ gateway or on the Hue bridge.
Genrally speaking, these rules are more reliable, more responsive, and functionally richer than HomeKit automations.  Furthermore, these rules don't require an Apple home hub.

The proxy sensor device can be exposed to HomeKit through [Homebridge deCONZ](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-deconz) or [Homebridge Hue2](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-hue2).
This provides a richer experience than using the native HomeKit feature of the FP2.
The Homebridge plugins include additional characteristics for _Last Motion_, _Dark_, and _Daylight_ and history for _Motion_ and _Light Level_.

## Work in Progress


### Aqara FP2
The Aqara Presence Sensor FP2 is a mmWave presence detector supporting multiple detection zones.
It also contains a light level sensor.
The sensor is powered over a USB-C connection, like the Aqara FP1 Human Presence Sensor.
However, unlike the FP1, the FP2 communicates over WiFi rather than Zigbee.
It supports HomeKit natively, exposing an _Occupancy Sensor_ and _Light Sensor_ service by default.

The FP2 can be bound to the Aqara app, next to its pairing with HomeKit.
It is configured through the Aqara app, as far as I can tell over the Aqara Home server.
Once configured, the sensor can be unbound from the app, and no longer communicates with the Aqara Home server.
For each configured detection zone, an additional _Occupancy Sensor_ service is exposed to HomeKit.

### Proxy Sensor Device
The proxy device consist of a number of CLIPPresence and CLIPLightLevel `sensors` resources on the deCONZ gateway or Hue bridge.
These CLIP resources mimic the ZHAPresence and ZHALightLevel resources for a Zigbee motion sensor.
Only the `state` of the CLIP resources is updated through the API, instead of from the Zigbee device.

`fp2-proxy` creates the CLIP resources and mirrors state changes of the FP2 to these,
effectively creating a virtual FP2 sensor on the deCONZ gateway or Hue bridge.

### `fp2-proxy`
Conceptually, `fp2-proxy` consists of a HAP client to connect to the FP2, and a REST API client to connect to the deCONZ gateway or Hue bridge.
The HAP client is from Andi's [hap-proxy](https://github.com/Supereg/hap-proxy).
The REST API clients are from Homebridge deCONZ and Homebridge Hue2.

FP2 sensors can be discovered over mDNS (Bonjour), but you still need to specify the PIN of each sensor to create a HAP pairing.
Similarly, deCONZ gateways and/or Hue bridges and be discovered, but you still need to select one, in case multiple gateways and/or bridges are discovered.
You will need to unlock the gateway or press the bridge link button to obtain an API key.
